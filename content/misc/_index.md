## Code
- **[Print neural network parameters](https://github.com/onedeeper/NNParamsPrinter.jl)** - [Julia] package to print parameters of a Lux neural network in a readable way.
- **[Draw fully connected networks](https://github.com/onedeeper/drawconnected)** - [Python] A function to draw fully connected networks with arbitrary layers and nodes. Useful for presentations and reports.
- **[Recurrent and fully connected neural networks from scratch](https://github.com/onedeeper/deeplearning/tree/main)** - [Python] Two notebooks where I develop two foundational machine learning models, the multi-layer perceptron and recurrent neural network, from scratch.
- **[Machine learning on EEG data for BCI applications in esports](https://github.com/onedeeper/lolbci)** - [Python] Classification of player mental states during League of Legends play using electrical signals recorded from the scalp (EEG).
- **[Auto-hyperparameter tuning for Reinforcement Learning with Optuna](https://github.com/onedeeper/deepRL)** - [Python] Learning the Gymnasium environment and hyper-parameter tuning for reinforcement learning on toy settings (Hopper and Bipedal walker).
- **[Observer - a python package for preparing and analyzing data from Dota 2 replays](https://github.com/onedeeper/observer/tree/main)** - [Python] For the paper "Implicit Coordination Dynamics: A Synchrony-based Study on Team Positioning and Performance in Competitive Dota 2", I developed a package to extract and analyze data from Dota 2 replays.
- **[Study of EEG recordings in linguistic experiments](https://github.com/onedeeper/neurodata/tree/main)** [Python] This project examines how rhythm affects sentence ambiguity processing in the brain using EEG data from multilingual participants, with findings suggesting minimal impact for late German learners.
- **[Depth first search and breadth first search](https://github.com/onedeeper/AIND)** [Python] Simple implementations of depth first search and breadth first search for educational purposes.
- **[Card games No Thanks! and Take 5 with Q-learning](https://github.com/onedeeper/gameswithRL/tree/main)** [Python] This project explores reinforcement learning strategies for card games No Thanks! and Take 5!, demonstrating the effectiveness of Q-learning with linear function approximation for complex game states.
