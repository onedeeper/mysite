## Code
- **[Print neural network parameters](https://github.com/onedeeper/NNParamsPrinter.jl)** - [Julia] package to print parameters of a Lux neural network in a readable way.
- **[Draw fully connected networks](https://github.com/onedeeper/drawconnected)** - [Python] A function to draw fully connected networks with arbitrary layers and nodes. Useful for presentations and reports.
- **[Recurrent and fully connected neural networks from scratch](https://github.com/onedeeper/deeplearning/tree/main)** - [Python] Two notebooks where I develop two foundational machine learning models, the mult-layer perceptron and recurrent neural network, from scratch.
- **[Machine learning on EEG data for BCI applications](https://github.com/onedeeper/lolbci)** - [Python] Classification of player mental states during League of Legends play using electrical signals recorded from the scalp (EEG).
- **[Auto-hyperparameter tuning for Reinforcement Learning with Optuna](https://github.com/onedeeper/deepRL)** - [Python] Learning the Gymnasium environment and hyper-parameter tuning for reinforcement learning on toy settings (Hopper and Bipedal walker).
