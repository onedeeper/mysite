This is my current best plan forward. It is subject to change. 

# More, better, humans.

The long-term vision is to ensure humanity’s survival and growth on Earth and beyond. Achieving this requires solutions to foundational challenges, such as producing sustainable life support systems and efficient resource utilization in environments with limited natural resources. Technology and understanding developed for space applications have the potential to significantly benefit Earth, especially in resource-scarce regions.

## Biology is a complex dynamical system.

Nature operates through interconnected, non-linear dynamical systems, whether in ecosystems, cellular biology, or astrophysical processes. These complex systems present unique challenges and opportunities; understanding them is critical for predicting, controlling, and utilizing them for human advancement.

Dynamical systems theory provides a mathematical foundation to model, simulate, and control these systems. Applications span a wide range, from biological processes like cell growth to environmental systems such as atmospheric control.

## Control and optimization of biological systems. 

Mastering the control of dynamical systems is essential for fields requiring resource optimization and resilience under constrained conditions. In space exploration, this involves creating sustainable ecosystems for food production, air, and water recycling. On Earth, the same principles can transform industries like agriculture, healthcare, and energy, allowing for more sustainable and efficient practices.

## Machine learning x Biology x Dynamical Systems.

Machine learning (ML) offers a unique capability to manage and understand dynamical systems. Combining ML with dynamical system models enables real-time process optimization and adaptability to dynamic environments. For example, reinforcement learning can be used to optimize closed-loop systems, enhancing resilience and efficiency.

Beyond control, ML also reveals insights into the underlying structures of complex systems. Hybrid approaches, such as universal differential equations (UDEs), combine neural networks with classical models to improve prediction and explanation, transforming AI into a tool for both discovery and control.

## Applications at the Intersection of Biology, Dynamical Systems, and ML

This interdisciplinary approach is highly applicable to various fields:
- **Biotechnology**: From cultured meat production to cellular and tissue engineering, dynamical systems control is key to advancing sustainable biological manufacturing.
- **Agriculture and Sustainability**: Precision farming and ecosystem management benefit from adaptive models that respond to environmental and resource variables in real-time.
- **Healthcare**: Modeling and controlling biological systems, such as drug response pathways or regenerative processes, enables personalized and precise medical interventions.
- **Space Exploration**: Closed-loop life support and efficient resource management systems are crucial for human expansion into space, including habitats on Mars or deep-space missions.

## Conclusion: A Broad, Long-Term Research Vision with Immediate Impact

The goal is to advance human knowledge and capability across biology, dynamical systems, and machine learning, addressing urgent challenges today while laying the groundwork for humanity’s future. By focusing on the control and understanding of complex systems, I hope to create solutions that enhance life on Earth and enable humanity to thrive beyond it.
